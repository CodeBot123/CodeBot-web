            SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard language used for retrieving, managing,
            and organizing data and databases. Learning SQL allows you to work in a wide variety
            of fields including but not limited to data science and analysis, market research,
            business analysis, software development, and so on.</p></div>
        
        <div class="whatsql2"><p id="whatsql2">
            SQL is the set of instructions used to interact with databases. It allows users to
            create, retrieve, update, and delete data. Of course, this is a straightforward 
            definition for such a complex subject. Let's go a little deeper.</P>
        </div>
        <ul id="whatsql3">
            <li>SQL is a special-purpose programming language designed for managing data stored in a relational database management system. </li>
            <br>
            <li>SQL is the language with which a coder communicates with a database to manipulate its data.</li>
            <br>
            <li>It is their guiding hand, voice, and fingertips dragging across a screen, helping the coder navigate and organise the data as they see fit. </li>
            <br>
            <li>It is how a coder converses with the machine.</li>
        </ul>

        <h1 id="question1">What is SQL used for?</h1>
        <div class="answer1"><p id="answer1">
            SQL is used for database architecture and management - making it a vital tool for
            anyone who wishes to pursue a career as a database administrator.<br>
            <br>
            For those unfamiliar with programming languages and website architecture, the work
            of SQL will often go unnoticed. Still, those who have seen behind the curtain will
            know it as one of the fundamental building blocks of modern database architecture.
        </p></div>

        <h1 id="question2">Why is SQL important?</h1>
        <div class="answer2"><p id="answer2">
            SQL provides a standardised method for interacting with databases, making it possible
            for users to work with different database systems regardless of the vendor. Additionally,
            SQL is widely used in data analytics and business intelligence applications, as it enables
            users to extract meaningful insights from large datasets. Invented in the 1970s, SQL has
            since become one of the most widely used programming languages for managing and querying databases.

        <h1 id="question3">Using SQL</h1>
        <div class="answer3">
            <ul id="answer3">
                <p>Data Security: SQL is used to manage user permissions and access controls.
                    It can define user roles and grant or revoke access to specific parts of a database.</p>
                    <br>
            <li>Data retrieval: SQL can be used to retrieve specific information from a database
                based on certain criteria.</li>
            <li>Data Modification: Developers can use SQL to insert new records, update existing
                information, and even to delete information from a database.  </li>
            <li>Data Management: SQL can help manage the structure of a database. It can create
            tables, define relationships between tables, and set constraints to ensure data integrity.</li>
            <li>Data Analysis: SQL is used to analyse data. It can aggregate data, calculate statistics,
                and generate reports.</li>
            <li>Data Integration: You can use SQL to combine data from different sources into a single
                dataset.</li></ul>
        </div>

        <h1 id="question4">Using SQL in Your Web Site</h1>
        <div class="answer4"><ul id="answer4">
            <p>To build a web site that shows data from a database, you will need:</p>
            <li>An RDBMS database program (i.e. MS Access, SQL Server, MySQL)</li>
            <li>To use a server-side scripting language, like PHP or ASP</li>
            <li>To use SQL to get the data you want</li>
            <li>To use HTML / CSS to style the page</li>
        </ul></div>

        <h1 id="question5">RDBMS</h1>
        <div class="answer5"><p id="answer5">
            RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System.<br>
            <br>
            RDBMS is the basis for SQL, and for all modern database systems such as MS SQL
            Server, IBM DB2, Oracle, MySQL, and Microsoft Access.<br>
            <br>
            The data in RDBMS is stored in database objects called tables. A table is a collection
            of related data entries and it consists of columns and rows.<br>
            <br>
            Look at the "Customers" table:
        </p></div>

        <div class="exsqlbox"><h1 id="exsql">Example:</h1>
            <div class="wsql"><p id="sqlcode">
                <span style="color: royalblue;">SELECT</span> <span style="color: white;">&nbsp;*</span> <span style="color: royalblue;">&nbsp;FROM</span> <span style="color: white;">&nbsp;Customers</span><br>
            </p></div></div>

        <div class="answer5-2"><p id="answer5-2">
            Every table is broken up into smaller entities called fields. The fields in the Customers
            table consist of CustomerID, CustomerName, ContactName, Address, City, PostalCode and Country.
            A field is a column in a table that is designed to maintain specific information about every
            record in the table.<br>
            <br>
            A record, also called a row, is each individual entry that exists in a table. For example, there
            are 91 records in the above Customers table. A record is a horizontal entity in a table.<br>
            <br>
            A column is a vertical entity in a table that contains all information associated with a specific 
            field in a table.
          
        </p></div>

        <p id="Donald-Chamberlin"><em>Donald Chamberlin</em></p>
        <div class="answer6"><p id="answer6">
            The SQL programming language was developed in the 1970s by IBM researchers Raymond Boyce and Donald
            Chamberlin. The programming language, known then as SEQUEL, was created following Edgar Frank Codd's
            paper, "A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks,"in 1970.
