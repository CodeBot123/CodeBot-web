            C++ is a general-purpose programming language that was developed as an
            enhancement of the C language to include object-oriented paradigm. It is
            an imperative and a compiled language.<br>
            <br>
            C++ is a high-level, general-purpose programming language designed for system
            and application programming. It was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs
            in 1983 as an extension of the C programming language. C++ is an object-oriented,
            multi-paradigm language that supports procedural, functional, and generic programming styles.
            One of the key features of C++ is its ability to support low-level, system-level
            programming, making it suitable for developing operating systems, device drivers,
            and other system software. At the same time, C++ also provides a rich set of libraries
            and features for high-level application programming, making it a popular choice for
            developing desktop applications, video games, and other complex applications.</P></div>

            C++ has a large, active community of developers and users, and a wealth of 
            resources and tools available for learning and using the language. Some of thekey features of C++ include:
            Object-Oriented Programming: C++ supports object-oriented programming, 
            allowing developers to create classes and objects and to define methods
            and properties for these objects.
            Templates: C++ templates allow developers to write generic code that can
            work with any data type, making it easier to write reusable and flexible code.
            Standard Template Library (STL): The STL provides a wide range of containers and
            algorithms for working with data, making it easier to write efficient and effective code.
            Exception Handling: C++ provides robust exception handling capabilities, making it
            easier to write code that can handle errors and unexpected situations.<br>
            <br>
            Overall, C++ is a powerful and versatile programming language that is widely used
            for a range of applications and is well-suited for both low-level system programming and high-level application development.<br>
            C++ is a middle-level language rendering it the advantage of programming low-level (drivers, kernels) and even higher-level
            applications (games, GUI, desktop apps etc.). The basic syntax and code structure of both C and C++ are the same. </p>

        <h1 id="question1">Why Use C++</h1>
            <ul id="answer1">
            <li>C++ is one of the world's most popular programming languages.</li>
            <li>C++ can be found in today's operating systems, Graphical User Interfaces, and embedded<br>
                systems.</li>
            <li>C++ is an object-oriented programming language which gives a clear structure to programs<br>
                and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs.</li>
            <li>C++ is portable and can be used to develop applications that can be adapted to multiple<br>
                platforms.</li>
            <li>C++ is fun and easy to learn!</li>
            <p>As C++ is close to C, C# and Java, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to C++ or vice<br>
                versa.</p>
        </ul>

        <h1 id="question2">Difference between C and C++</h1>
        <p id="answer2">
            C++ was developed as an extension of C, and both languages have almost the same syntax.<br>
            The main difference between C and C++ is that C++ support classes and objects, while C<br>
            does not.

                C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Laboratories over a<br>
                period starting in 1979 . Since C++ is an attempt to add object-oriented<br>
                features(plus other improvements) to C, earlier it was called as "C with<br>
                Objects". As thelanguage developed, Stroustrup named it as C++ in 1983.</p>
