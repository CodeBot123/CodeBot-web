            Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation
            dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers write once, and run anywhere (WORA),
            meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.
            Java was first released in 1995 and is widely used for developing applications for desktop, web, and mobile
            devices. Java is known for its simplicity, robustness, and security features, making it a popular choice for
            enterprise-level applications.

            JAVA was developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems Inc in the year 1995 and later acquired by Oracle
            Corporation. It is a simple programming language. Java makes writing, compiling, and debugging programming easy.
            It helps to create reusable code and modular programs. Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming language
            and is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. A general-purpose programming language
            made for developers to write once run anywhere that is compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java.
            Java applications are compiled to byte code that can run on any Java Virtual Machine. The syntax of Java is similar
            to c/c++.</P>

            Java's history is very interesting. It is a programming language created in 1991. James Gosling, Mike
            Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton, a team of Sun engineers known as the Green team initiated the Java language in 1991.
            Sun Microsystems released its first public implementation in 1996 as Java 1.0. It provides no-cost -run-times on popular
            platforms. Java1.0 compiler was re-written in Java by Arthur Van Hoff to strictly comply with its specifications. With
            the arrival of Java 2, new versions had multiple configurations built for different types of platforms.
            <br>
            In 1997, Sun Microsystems approached the ISO standards body and later formalized Java, but it soon withdrew from the
            process. At one time, Sun made most of its Java implementations available without charge, despite their proprietary
            software status. Sun generated revenue from Java through the selling of licenses for specialized products such as the
            Java Enterprise System.
